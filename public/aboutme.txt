About Me


I'm Byron, a 48-year-old passionate individual from El Salvador. Blessed with a wonderful family, I cherish every moment spent with my son and daughter. A sports enthusiast at heart, I find joy in staying active and enjoying the thrill of competition.

Beyond my personal life, I have a deep-rooted interest in coding. It's a field that captivates me, and I aspire to immerse myself in it daily. My fluency in both English and Spanish has opened doors to diverse experiences and opportunities. 

Traveling is another passion that allows me to explore new cultures and broaden my horizons.
